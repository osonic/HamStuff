hamlib for Borland's Kylix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a Kylix binding for use with Hamlib.  Binding consists of three files:

hamlib_rigapi.pas :

    This file have the same function as `rig.h' for the C language.  This 
    file should also be kept synchronized with `rig.h`.

hamlib_rotapi.pas

    This file have the same function as `rotator.h' for the C language. This 
    file should be kept synchronized with 'rotator.h'.

HamlibComponents.pas

    This file contain two components that encapsulate the rig and rotator 
    frontends.  It is very simular to the C++ class.

  
A simple test program is included in the tests/ directory.  It implements
a selection dialog and a very simple Radio Control dialog.

This binding was develop with Borland Kylix Open Edition Ver 2.0. Open Edition
is freely downloadable from Borland's website for use with GPL projects.
