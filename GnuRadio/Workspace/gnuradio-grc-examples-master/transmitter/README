This directory contains simple but functional transmitter examples
implemented using the GNU Radio Companion.

Before you execute any of the scripts you should check the USRP and
audio settings to ensure that they are compatible with your hardware.

The lsb_tx_bpf.grc and usb_tx_bpf.grc examples are simple SSB transmitters
implemented using simple AM modulation where the sideband is selected
uasing a complex band pass filter.
